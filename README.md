Welcome! 
Thanks for checking out my 'I love cats!' project

Project Description:

This project was an exercise for practicing the use of NPM and Gulp. This is a simple project where repeatedly pushing an on screen button places pictures of cats on the screen.

How to open:

Using the command prompt, copy and paste 'code ~/oca/startnow-ops100-gulp-and-npm' and push enter. This will open the project in visual studio code. To start and test this application, run 'gulp' in Terminal.
